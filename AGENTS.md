# Observatório de Integridade — Context & Guidelines

## Project Overview

The **Observatório de Integridade**/**Integrity Observatory** is a Rails 8 application that monitors Portuguese (and broader European) public procurement data to detect corruption risk, abuse patterns, and conflicts of interest. It is designed for journalists, auditors, and civic watchdogs.

The approach is **risk scoring, not accusation**. The system surfaces cases for audit or journalistic review with explicit confidence levels — it does not produce conclusions.

---

## Domain Model

- **Entity**: Represents both public bodies (adjudicantes) and private companies (adjudicatários). Identified by `tax_identifier` (e.g. NIF/NIPC), scoped to `country_code` — the same numeric ID can exist in different countries.
- **Contract**: A public procurement record with metadata (object, price, dates, procedure type, CPV, location). Linked to a contracting entity and a data source.
- **ContractWinner**: Join table between `Contract` and `Entity`. A contract can have multiple winners with a `price_share`.
- **DataSource**: DB-driven registry of configured data adapters per country. Each record specifies `adapter_class`, `country_code`, `source_type`, and JSON `config`.

## Key Data Sources

### Portugal

| Source | What it provides | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Portal BASE** | Central public contracts portal — contracts, announcements, modifications, impugnations | Primary source. Data published in OCDS format on dados.gov.pt via IMPIC. API access available for bulk extraction (registration required). Data quality is the responsibility of contracting entities — late or incomplete entries are themselves risk signals. |
| **Portal da Transparência SNS** | Health-sector contracts via OpenDataSoft v2.1 | ~43,000 records. No API key required. `PublicContracts::PT::SnsClient`. |
| **dados.gov.pt** | Open data platform, includes BASE mirrors | Use for bulk OCDS downloads |
| **TED** | EU-level procurement notices | Valuable for contracts at EU thresholds and cross-checking publication consistency |
| **Registo Comercial** | Company registrations, shareholders, management | Scraped from publicacoes.mj.pt |
| **Entidade Transparência** | Public entities, mandates, persons in public roles | https://entidadetransparencia.pt/ — useful for conflict-of-interest checks |
| **RCBE** | Beneficial ownership register | Access requires authentication by legal person number; CJEU ruling limited open access — treat as a constrained layer |
| **AdC** | Competition Authority — cartel cases, sanctions | Cross-reference supplier NIFs against published AdC cases |
| **Tribunal de Contas** | Audit reports, financial liability decisions | Used to corroborate red flags |
| **Mais Transparência / Portugal2020** | EU-funded contract data | Useful for prioritising EU-funded tenders |
| **ECFP/CNE** | Political party donations | Future source for conflict-of-interest detection |

### EU / Cross-border

| Source | What it provides |
|---|---|
| **TED** | EU procurement notices via REST API and bulk XML packages |

## Red Flag Catalogue

Indicators are grouped into three tracks following OECD methodology:

### Track A — Rule-based red flags (high explainability)

| # | Indicator | Data fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A1 | Repeat direct awards / prior consultations to same supplier by same authority | `procedure_type`, `contracting_entity_id`, winner NIF, `publication_date` | OECD: repeat awards and concentration over 3 years |
| A2 | Contract published after execution starts | `publication_date`, `celebration_date`, `execution_start_date` | OECD: contract data earlier than adjudication date |
| A3 | Execution begins before publication in BASE | `publication_date` vs actual start | OECD: contracts implemented before publication |
| A4 | Amendment inflation — large or frequent modifications | `base_price`, amendment value, amendment count | BASE publishes modifications above thresholds |
| A5 | Contract value just below procedural thresholds | `base_price`, `procedure_type` | Threshold-splitting / fragmentation |
| A6 | Single bidder / low-competition procedure | bidder count, `procedure_type` | BASE publishes procedure type and bidder details |
| A7 | Buyer uses direct award far above peer median for same CPV | `procedure_type`, `cpv_code`, `contracting_entity_id` | Peer comparison by CPV and region |
| A8 | Long execution duration (> 3 years) | contract duration | OECD: execution length over 3 years as risk feature |
| A9 | Estimated value vs final price anomaly | `base_price`, `total_effective_price` | OECD: ratios between estimated, base, and contract price |

### Track B — Pattern-based anomaly flags (statistical / model)

| # | Indicator | Approach |
|---|---|---|
| B1 | Bid rotation — suppliers who rarely compete except with one authority | Cluster analysis of winner NIF × authority pairs |
| B2 | Supplier concentration — share of buyer's spend to one supplier | Herfindahl-style concentration index by authority + CPV |
| B3 | Unusual pricing relative to CPV and region peers | Z-score or percentile within CPV × region × year |
| B4 | Sudden procedural shifts near budget deadlines | Time series of procedure type distribution per authority |

### Track C — Integrity and compliance risk

| # | Indicator | Data fields | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1 | Missing supplier NIF | `tax_identifier` null or invalid | OECD: VAT number completeness is itself a risk signal |
| C2 | Impossible date sequences | date ordering checks | Catches data manipulation or late entry |
| C3 | Missing mandatory fields by procedure type | CPV, location, base price | Absence is a risk signal, not just a data defect |
| C4 | Supplier overlap with AdC sanction cases | winner NIF × AdC case database | OECD: AdC sanctions enriched with NIF for cross-referencing |
| C5 | Entity name variations masking same entity | fuzzy match + NIF | Entity resolution is mandatory — names vary widely |
| C6 | Contract not submitted to TdC when required | TdC data (constrained) | Some indicators require TdC internal data |

### Data quality as a flag

Missing or inconsistent data is not just a technical defect — it can indicate evasion. Flag:
- Missing supplier NIF
- Missing CPV code
- Contract amendments with missing legal basis
- Repeated manual text variations for the same entity name
- Date fields outside plausible ranges

---

## Scoring Architecture

Each flagged case should carry:
- **Risk score** (weighted sum of active flags)
- **Evidence fields** (which fields triggered the flag)
- **Data completeness score** (fraction of expected fields present)
- **Confidence level** (low / medium / high — degrades when key fields are missing)

This prevents weak data from producing overconfident conclusions.

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 — Procurement spine *(in progress)*
Build a clean ingestion pipeline normalising core fields across all adapters (contract ID, authority NIF, supplier NIF, procedure type, CPV, prices, dates). Multi-country adapter framework in place. Domain model complete with country-scoped uniqueness. Target: full Portal BASE + SNS data loaded, all C-track data quality flags firing.

### Phase 2 — Rule-based flags *(next)*
Implement Track A flags one by one as DB-level queries or lightweight services. Each flag is a separate, independently testable unit. Deploy dashboard filter and case drill-down as flags come online. Order of implementation:
1. A2/A3 — date anomalies (already partially firing from `celebration_date < publication_date`)
2. A9 — price-to-estimate anomaly (base vs effective price ratio)
3. A5 — threshold-splitting (contract value just below €5K / €20K / €75K / €150K thresholds)
4. A1 — repeat direct awards (same authority + supplier, window of 36 months)
5. A4 — amendment inflation (requires amendment data ingestion from BASE)
6. A7 — abnormal direct award rate (peer comparison by CPV, needs sufficient data volume)
7. A6 — single bidder (requires bidder count from BASE)
8. A8 — long execution (requires execution dates)

### Phase 3 — External enrichment *(planned)*
Ingest and cross-reference additional sources:
- **TED**: cross-check publication consistency for EU-threshold tenders; flag contracts above threshold that are absent from TED
- **AdC**: match supplier NIFs against Competition Authority sanction list (C4)
- **Entidade Transparência**: link contract parties to persons in public roles; surface potential conflicts of interest
- **Mais Transparência / Portugal2020**: tag EU-funded contracts for prioritised scrutiny

### Phase 4 — Graph database layer *(planned)*
Relational SQL is sufficient for per-contract flags but breaks down when the question is about *networks* — who is connected to whom, through how many hops, and how central they are. This phase builds a parallel graph representation alongside the relational DB.

**Why a graph database:**
- Bid rotation (B1) requires detecting clusters of suppliers who co-appear without competing — this is a graph community detection problem, not a SQL aggregation
- Ownership chains require multi-hop traversal: supplier → shareholder → public official → contracting entity
- Entity resolution across sources (name variants, NIFs that appear in multiple roles) maps naturally to a property graph
- Network centrality scoring: flag entities that are unusually central in the procurement network

**Implementation approach:**
- Store the core data in SQLite/PostgreSQL (Rails ActiveRecord) as today
- Project a graph from it into Neo4j (or similar) as a read-optimised view: Entity nodes, Contract nodes, AWARDED_TO / EMPLOYED_BY / OWNS / RELATED_TO edges
- Run graph algorithms (PageRank, Louvain community detection, shortest path) against the graph layer
- Feed results back as scored flags into the Rails flag system
- Refresh the graph on each import cycle

**Key graph queries:**
- Detect supplier clusters that never compete against each other (bid rotation)
- Find shortest path between a supplier NIF and a public official NIF
- Identify entities that are both winners and connected to contracting authority management
- Score network centrality of each entity as a risk amplifier

### Phase 5 — Statistical/pattern flags *(planned)*
Implement Track B indicators once data volume is sufficient for meaningful statistics:
- B2: Herfindahl concentration index per authority × CPV (requires at least 2 years of data)
- B3: Z-score pricing anomaly within CPV × region × year
- B4: Procedural shift time-series per authority
- B1: Bid rotation (via graph layer from Phase 4)

### Phase 6 — Case triage + deployment *(parallel track)*
This runs in parallel with Phases 2–5:
- Deploy to production (Kamal config already present)
- Case triage UI: per-case evidence trail, confidence level display, flag breakdown
- Export format for referrals (PDF / structured JSON) to TdC, AdC, MENAC
- User accounts and case assignment (for newsroom / audit team use)
- Public vs restricted view split

### Phase 7 — Ownership layer *(constrained)*
RCBE beneficial ownership linkage. Access requires legal person authentication and the 2022 CJEU ruling limits public exposure. Build as a restricted layer available only to authenticated auditors. Track changes — ownership structures shift around procurement cycles.

## To-Do List

### Now — get the data in
- [ ] Run full Portal BASE ingestion (all pages, not just first batch) — target ~300K+ contracts
- [ ] Run SNS Portal ingestion (~43K health contracts)
- [ ] Verify NIF completeness rate across both sources — flag missing NIF records
- [ ] Verify CPV completeness — flag contracts missing CPV
- [ ] Add SNS data source to EN README data sources table
- [ ] Confirm `celebration_date < publication_date` flag is persisted to DB (not just displayed in UI)
- [ ] Add `Flag` model: `contract_id`, `flag_type`, `severity`, `details` (JSON), `fired_at`
- [ ] Add `FlagService` base class that each Track A flag inherits from
- [ ] Seed: run import on all active DataSources

### Rule-based flags — one by one (Track A)
- [ ] **A2/A3** — date anomaly flag: `celebration_date < publication_date` → fire flag, persist to DB
- [ ] **A9** — price anomaly: `total_effective_price / base_price` outside [0.5, 1.5] → fire flag
- [ ] **A5** — threshold splitting: `base_price` within 5% below €5K, €20K, €75K, €150K
- [ ] **A1** — repeat direct awards: same `contracting_entity_id` + winner NIF, 3+ in 36 months
- [ ] **A4** — amendment inflation: requires BASE amendment endpoint ingestion first
- [ ] **A7** — abnormal direct award rate: authority's direct award % vs CPV peer median
- [ ] Dashboard: replace hardcoded sample insights with real fired flags
- [ ] Dashboard: severity filter (Todos / Crítico / Alto / Médio) wired to real flags
- [ ] Contract show page: display fired flags for that contract

### External enrichment (Phase 3)
- [ ] TED ingestion: full PT notices (32K+ records), cross-check with BASE by NIF + date
- [ ] AdC sanction list: scrape/download, build NIF lookup table, wire to C4 flag
- [ ] Entidade Transparência: ingest mandates, link entity NIFs to public roles

### Graph database (Phase 4)
- [ ] Evaluate: Neo4j (full-featured) vs Memgraph (lighter) vs pg_graphql (Postgres extension)
- [ ] Design graph schema: Entity, Contract nodes; AWARDED_TO, EMPLOYED_AT, OWNS, RELATED_TO edges
- [ ] Build graph export job: project Rails data into graph on each import cycle
- [ ] Implement Louvain community detection → bid rotation flag (B1)
- [ ] Implement shortest path: supplier NIF → public official NIF → contracting authority
- [ ] Feed graph scores back as flags into the Rails flag system

### Statistical flags (Phase 5)
- [ ] Accumulate ≥2 years of data before computing B3 (z-score pricing) to avoid sparse-data noise
- [ ] B2: Herfindahl index per authority × CPV — wire to dashboard concentration view
- [ ] B4: Procedural shift time-series per authority per year

### Deployment + go live (Phase 6 — parallel)
- [ ] Configure Kamal deploy: `.kamal/deploy.yml`, set RAILS_MASTER_KEY, DB path, Caddy proxy
- [ ] Switch DB to PostgreSQL for production (keep SQLite for dev/test)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow already present — verify it runs on push to master
- [ ] Environment: configure `.env` secrets via Kamal secrets, rotate TED API key
- [ ] Add basic HTTP auth or invite-only access for beta launch
- [ ] Set up error monitoring (Sentry or equivalent)
- [ ] Performance: add DB indexes on `contracting_entity_id`, `celebration_date`, `procedure_type`, `cpv_code`
- [ ] Add pagination/search to contracts index (already done — verify performance at 300K rows)
- [ ] Go live: deploy to VPS, configure domain, verify health check at `/up`

### Ownership layer (Phase 7 — constrained)
- [ ] Assess RCBE API access — authenticated endpoint for auditors
- [ ] Model `BeneficialOwner`: `entity_id`, `owner_name`, `owner_nif`, `ownership_pct`, `as_of_date`
- [ ] Feed RCBE data into graph layer (Phase 4) as OWNS edges

## Key Data Quality Notes

- BASE data quality is the responsibility of contracting entities — treat inconsistencies as risk signals.
- Entity resolution is mandatory: supplier names vary; always match on NIF where available, then fuzzy name + CPV.
- Some OECD indicators could not be developed due to data availability — document which flags are constrained.
- Beneficial ownership linkage is constrained by RCBE access rules and the CJEU ruling — do not assume it can be automated.
